# Time-Series-101-Manipulating-Time-Series-with-Python

Time Series is not so popular yet an important topic in predictive analytics. People often focus on techniques like machine learning models and deep learning frameworks that they tend to ignore concepts like time series forecasting. The former makes you a programmer while the latter makes you an engineer. 

I am starting a series of posts on Github to share my knowledge of Time Series in Python. 

The first episode of Time Series 101 talks about pre-processing time series and gets into the process of understanding more about your time-series. 

After completing this notebook and following along, you will be able to:

<li> Learn how to import time series and convert it to datetime data type </li>
<li> Index, slice and manipulate time series </li>
<li> Upsample (Increase frequency) and Downsample (Decrease frequency) of your time series data </li>
<li> Learn different methods to fill missing values while upsampling data </li>
<li> Walk over methods of aggregation while downsampling time series data </li> 
<li> Learn how to use rolling Window function to understand your time series data at a more macro level </li>
<li> Have two time series? Learn how to compare time series with correlation </li>
